# Cinema Room Manager ðŸŽ¥

A repository documenting the learning process for the Kotlin project *Cinema Room Manager* from [Hyperskill](https://hyperskill.org/).

## About
This project implements a simulation of a cinema ticket booking system in Kotlin with the following features:
- Allows users to interactively view, book seats, and view statistics
- Validates inputs and ensures accurate seat management
- Displays a seating chart for the cinema
- Calculates and displays income statistics

## Features
- **Seat Management**: Users can view available seats, book tickets, and see the updated seating chart.
- **Input Validation**: Handles invalid inputs, out-of-range row/column numbers, and already booked seats.
- **Income Calculation**: Tracks current income, total income potential, and percentage of tickets sold.
- **Statistics Display**: Provides comprehensive statistics, including the number of purchased tickets and their percentage.

## Learning Outcomes
Through this project, I learned:
- Object-oriented programming and best practices in Kotlin
- Handling user input and ensuring robust validation
- Implementing interactive console applications
- Managing mutable state effectively
- Using `companion object` for storing constants
- Designing a clear and maintainable code structure
